<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Hey there, I'm aiktb, a Web Full-Stack Developer brimming with enthusiasm for the modern web ecosystem.

My goal is to actively engage in the Github open-source community, crafting and maintaining some really useful stuff for people. It'd be awesome if my work and blog articles could be of help to you. ðŸ˜Ž

Additionally, this blog is powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), which is lightning-fast and an excellent fit for building blogs!

Currently, I'm particularly interested in the following tech stack:

<Framework />

Beyond the technical realm, I have a wide interest in ACG. In fact, my ID is derived from the song [aikotoba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WptXk39wiIQ) composed by [@DECO\*27](https://twitter.com/DECO27). The name of this blog project, **_Rea_** is taken from the anime [Sankarea](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%95%E3%82%93%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8C%E3%81%82) that I was watching at the time. Feel free to check out my [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/aiktb) if you're interested.
